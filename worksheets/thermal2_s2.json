  {
    "question": "Why might a glass tumbler crack when very hot water is poured into it?",
    "options": ["The water chemically reacts with the glass", "The inside expands faster than the outside", "The glass melts", "Air bubbles in the glass explode"],
    "answer": "The inside expands faster than the outside",
    "time": 30,
    "explanation": "The inner surface of the glass gains thermal energy and expands quickly, while the outer surface remains cooler and expands less. This uneven expansion creates stress that can crack the glass."

  {
    "question": "In a fire alarm, a bimetallic strip is used. When heated by the fire, it bends and completes an electrical circuit. Which way does it bend?",
    "options": ["Towards the metal that expands more", "Towards the metal that expands less", "It depends on the shape", "It does not bend; it contracts"],
    "answer": "Towards the metal that expands less",
    "time": 30,
    "explanation": "The metal that expands more becomes longer on that side, causing the strip to curve with the expanding metal on the outside of the curve, bending towards the metal that expands less."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why do dentists use filling materials that expand and contract at the same rate as teeth?",
    "options": ["To match the color", "To prevent the filling from falling out or cracking the tooth", "To make it cheaper", "To make it last longer"],
    "answer": "To prevent the filling from falling out or cracking the tooth",
    "time": 30,
    "explanation": "If the filling expands or contracts at a different rate than the tooth when drinking hot or cold liquids, it could create gaps or put stress on the tooth, leading to damage."

  {
    "question": "A metal hoop can be fitted tightly around a wooden wheel by first heating it. What happens when the hoop cools?",
    "options": ["It expands and becomes loose", "It contracts and grips the wheel tightly", "It changes color", "It becomes brittle"],
    "answer": "It contracts and grips the wheel tightly",
    "time": 30,
    "explanation": "When heated, the metal hoop expands and is slipped over the wheel. As it cools, it loses thermal energy and contracts, creating a very tight, secure fit around the wheel."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following statements about water is TRUE?",
    "options": ["Water expands uniformly when cooled at all temperatures", "Water is heaviest at 0°C", "Water is heaviest at 4°C", "Ice is heavier than water"],
    "answer": "Water is heaviest at 4°C",
    "time": 30,
    "explanation": "Water reaches its maximum density (is heaviest) at 4°C. Below this temperature, it expands until it freezes at 0°C, which is why ice floats on water."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why do pipelines carrying hot oil often have loops or bends in them?",
    "options": ["To slow down the flow", "To allow for expansion and contraction", "To make them easier to paint", "To trap impurities"],
    "answer": "To allow for expansion and contraction",
    "time": 30,
    "explanation": "The loops act as expansion joints. When the pipe gains thermal energy from the hot oil and expands, the loops can flex and absorb the movement without causing stress or damage."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the main reason overhead power lines are more likely to snap in winter than in summer?",
    "options": ["They become brittle in the cold", "Ice adds weight to the lines", "They contract and become tighter, increasing tension", "More electricity flows in winter"],
    "answer": "They contract and become tighter, increasing tension",
    "time": 30,
    "explanation": "In winter, the metal wires lose thermal energy and contract. This increases the tension (tightness) on the wires. If the tension becomes too great, they can snap."
  },
  {
    "question": "A bimetallic strip is straight at room temperature. When cooled significantly below room temperature, which way will it bend?",
    "options": ["Towards the metal that expands more when heated", "Towards the metal that contracts more when cooled", "It will remain straight", "It will twist instead of bend"],
    "answer": "Towards the metal that contracts more when cooled",
    "time": 30,
    "explanation": "When cooled, both metals contract. The metal that normally expands more when heated will also contract more when cooled. This causes the strip to bend with that metal on the inside of the curve."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is it important to leave an expansion gap when laying long sections of flooring or tiling?",
    "options": ["To allow for cleaning", "To let air circulate", "To allow the floor to expand without buckling", "To save materials"],
    "answer": "To allow the floor to expand without buckling",
    "time": 30,
    "explanation": "Flooring materials expand when they gain thermal energy (and sometimes from moisture). Without a gap at the edges, the expanding floor would have nowhere to go and would buckle or lift up."
