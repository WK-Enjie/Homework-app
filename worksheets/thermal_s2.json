    "options": ["To absorb more thermal energy in winter", "To look clean", "To reflect thermal radiation away from the room in hot climates", "To prevent convection currents"],
    "answer": "To reflect thermal radiation away from the room in hot climates",
    "time": 30,
    "points": 10,
    "explanation": "White or light-colored, shiny surfaces are poor absorbers and good reflectors of thermal radiation. This helps keep the room cooler by reflecting thermal energy back downwards/outwards."
  },
  {
    "question": "In a vacuum flask (thermos), which thermal energy transfer methods are reduced by the vacuum between the double walls?",
    "options": ["Conduction and Convection", "Radiation only", "Conduction only", "Convection only"],
    "answer": "Conduction and Convection",
    "time": 30,
    "points": 12,
    "explanation": "A vacuum has no particles, so it prevents thermal energy transfer by conduction (particle collision) and convection (particle movement). Radiation is reduced by the silvered surfaces."

  {
    "question": "Why does a land breeze occur at night near a coastline?",
    "options": ["The land cools faster than the sea, causing air over land to sink", "The sea cools faster than the land, causing air over sea to rise", "The moon pulls the warm air towards the land", "Radiation from the land warms the sea"],
    "answer": "The land cools faster than the sea, causing air over land to sink",
    "time": 30,
    "points": 15,
    "explanation": "At night, land cools down quickly (by radiation). The air above it cools, becomes denser, and sinks (high pressure). The warmer air over the sea rises, creating a convection current that pulls the cool air from land to sea."

  {
    "question": "In an experiment to compare thermal conductivity, rods of copper, iron, and glass are coated with wax and heated at one end. Which rod's wax will melt first?",
    "options": ["Glass", "Iron", "Copper", "All at the same time"],
    "answer": "Copper",
    "time": 30,
    "points": 12,
    "explanation": "Copper is a much better thermal conductor than iron or glass. Thermal energy will travel fastest along the copper rod, causing the wax on it to melt first."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does a greenhouse effect work to trap thermal energy?",
    "options": ["It prevents convection completely", "Glass lets sunlight in but traps infrared radiation", "Glass conducts thermal energy from the sun", "It reflects all light back to space"],
    "answer": "Glass lets sunlight in but traps infrared radiation",
    "time": 30,
    "points": 12,
    "explanation": "Sunlight (short-wave radiation) passes through the glass and warms the interior. The warm objects inside emit infrared (long-wave) radiation, which cannot pass through the glass as easily, trapping the thermal energy."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is designed primarily to minimize thermal energy loss by convection?",
    "options": ["Silvered surface on a kettle", "Double-glazed windows with a vacuum", "Loft insulation (fiberglass wool)", "A metal heat sink on a CPU"],
    "answer": "Double-glazed windows with a vacuum",
    "time": 30,
    "points": 15,
    "explanation": "The vacuum (or even just the trapped air gap) between the glass panes prevents air particles from moving and transferring thermal energy by convection from the inside pane to the outside pane."
  },
  {
    "question": "You step onto a tiled bathroom floor and a carpeted area on the same floor. The tiles feel colder than the carpet. Why?",
    "options": ["The tiles are actually at a lower temperature", "Tiles are better conductors and draw thermal energy away from your foot faster", "The carpet generates its own thermal energy", "Carpet is a better conductor"],
    "answer": "Tiles are better conductors and draw thermal energy away from your foot faster",
    "time": 30,
    "points": 12,
    "explanation": "Both materials are at the same room temperature. Tiles are good conductors, so they rapidly transfer thermal energy away from your warm foot, making them feel cold. Carpet is an insulator, so less thermal energy is drawn from your foot."
  },
  {
    "question": "In which state of matter is convection NOT possible?",
    "options": ["Gas", "Liquid", "Solid", "Plasma"],
    "answer": "Solid",
    "time": 30,
    "points": 8,
    "explanation": "Convection requires the physical movement of particles within the substance. In a solid, particles are fixed in position and cannot flow, so only conduction is possible."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are cooling fins on engines and electronics often painted black?",
    "options": ["To look more attractive", "To prevent rust", "To increase the rate of cooling by radiation", "To reduce weight"],
    "answer": "To increase the rate of cooling by radiation",
    "time": 30,
    "points": 10,
    "explanation": "Dull, black surfaces are excellent emitters of thermal radiation. Painting the fins black helps them radiate away excess thermal energy more efficiently, cooling the device."
  },
  {
    "question": "In the Leslie's Cube experiment, which face of the cube filled with hot water will radiate the most thermal energy?",
    "options": ["The shiny silver face", "The dull black face", "The white painted face", "All faces radiate equally"],
    "answer": "The dull black face",
    "time": 30,
    "points": 10,
    "explanation": "The Leslie's Cube experiment demonstrates that a dull black surface is the best emitter of infrared radiation, so the thermal energy detector will show the highest reading when pointed at the black face."

  {
    "question": "Which of the following is an application of a poor conductor of thermal energy (insulator)?",
    "options": ["Copper bottom of a pan", "Iron radiator", "Fiberglass in the attic", "Aluminum heat sink"],
    "answer": "Fiberglass in the attic",
    "time": 30,
    "points": 8,
    "explanation": "Fiberglass traps air in small pockets. Air is a poor conductor. This prevents thermal energy loss from the house by conduction (and reduces convection), making it a good insulator."
  },
  {
    "question": "A student places a colored paper fan behind a glass of hot water. The fan's blades start to turn. What type of thermal energy transfer is primarily responsible for this?",
    "options": ["Conduction through the glass", "Radiation from the water", "Convection currents in the air", "All three equally"],
    "answer": "Convection currents in the air",
    "time": 30,
    "points": 10,
    "explanation": "The hot water transfers thermal energy to the air around the glass. This warm air rises (convection). The rising air current hits the paper fan blades, causing them to move."
